## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
Imagine a farmer in rural Punjab who’s unsure what crop to plant next season, worried about sudden rains ruining his harvest, or unsure whether the yellowing on his crops is due to disease or just bad soil. Now, imagine if this same farmer could pull out his phone, speak in Punjabi, upload a photo of the crop, and instantly get trusted, localized advice — all without needing to read or write.

We propose building a smart, AI-powered mobile app and chatbot that acts like a digital farming assistant, available 24/7 — in the farmer’s own language and tailored to his farm’s conditions.

What the App Will Do:

Talk Like a Local: The app will speak and understand Punjabi and other regional dialects — not just in text, but also voice — making it friendly for farmers with low literacy levels.

Soil & Fertilizer Guidance: Based on soil test results (uploaded manually or synced via government records), it will recommend exactly what fertilizers to use, how much, and when — avoiding waste and improving soil health.

Pest & Disease Diagnosis via Photos:

Farmers can snap a photo of a diseased leaf or insect.

The AI will identify the issue and provide simple, actionable remedies using locally available solutions.

Weather-Based Smart Alerts:

Real-time weather warnings (rain, heatwaves, frost).

Tailored advice like “avoid spraying pesticides today” or “ideal time to sow wheat is in 3 days”.

What to Grow, When, and Why:

Personalized crop suggestions based on soil type, rainfall, and past cropping patterns.

Promotes sustainable crop rotation and increases income.

Market Linkage & Mandi Prices:

Get daily updates on crop prices in nearby mandis.

Alerts when prices spike — so farmers can decide the best time and place to sell.

Offline & Low-Tech Friendly:

App works offline with key information cached.

For those without smartphones, an IVR system (Interactive Voice Response) gives voice advisories via normal phone calls.

Feedback = Smarter App:

Farmers can give feedback on advice.

The AI learns and adapts based on what works on the ground.


## Technical Approach

We’ll use a mix of modern technologies, but keep the experience simple for the end user.

 Tech Stack Overview:

AI/ML: To identify pests, optimize fertilizer use, and recommend crops.

NLP & TTS: Natural language understanding (NLP) and text-to-speech (TTS) to make the app conversational in local languages.

Weather APIs: To fetch real-time and forecasted weather data.

Soil & Crop Databases: Integrated with government soil health databases and ICAR advisories.

## Feasibility and Viability

Accessibility: 74% of rural households now have access to mobile phones. Many use voice apps like WhatsApp or YouTube daily.

Data Availability: With support from government departments (like Punjab Agri Dept and ICAR), we can access soil health, mandi prices, and cropping patterns.

Technology Readiness: The AI models for pest detection, NLP in Indian languages, and weather APIs are already mature and customizable.

## Impact and Benefits

For Farmers:

Up to 30% increase in yield through timely, science-backed decisions.

Reduction in input costs (fertilizer, pesticide) by 15–20%.

More confident, independent decision-making — reducing reliance on shopkeepers or guesswork.

For the Environment:

Better soil health through precision fertilizer use.

Reduced water and chemical waste.

Promotes crop rotation and biodiversity.

For Rural Economies:

Higher and more stable incomes.

Empowered farmer communities.

Data-driven insights to inform state policies and subsidies.


## Research and References

While working on this project, I came across some really eye-opening insights:

In areas like Sangrur and Mansa, I noticed many farmers still rely on word-of-mouth advice from local dealers or neighbors — which often leads to overuse of fertilizers or wrong crop choices.

I looked into pilots like KisanMitra and Digital Green, where voice-based advisories in local languages helped increase farmer adoption. That really reinforced the idea of adding multilingual voice support.

The AgriStack initiative and the Soil Health Card scheme made me realize there's already valuable data out there — it just needs to be made usable at the farmer level.

I also explored ISRO’s Bhuvan portal and IMD's weather APIs, which can be used to give real-time, location-based insights for farmers (like alerts before rainfall or sowing suggestions).

Finally, projects like Bhashini and tools from IndicNLP gave me confidence that we can build natural, voice-based interactions in Punjabi and other regional languages — even for farmers who aren't digitally literate.
